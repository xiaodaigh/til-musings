Pix, Brazil's national electronic payment system, has overtaken Visa and Mastercard. Pix sounds like a mix between tap payment and EFTPOS. I've always thought that Australia is the ideal place to set up a national payments system like that and let people tap on their cards to pay for things. 

I also keep in mind many of the horror stories I have heard about Brazil's banking system. Things that I'd like to understand are: how prevalent is Visa and Masterin Brazil?
